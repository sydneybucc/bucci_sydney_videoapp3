# Audio/Video App Pt.2

Node.js-based video application with the ability to watch movie trailers.

## Getting Started

Node.js will need to be installed, as well as Terminal for Mac or Cmder for Windows. Laragon Wamp was used for this project which will have Cmder, and built in Database/SQL.

### Prerequisites

Find and download Node.js and Laragon Wamp

```
https://nodejs.org/en/
https://laragon.org/
```

### Installing

Once Node.js is installed to the computer, open Terminal/Cmder, cd into work files:

```
cd *folder name*
```

and type:

```
npm install
```

This will install the Node.js files needed into the work files.

## Running the tests

To run tests and see if files are working, navigate to the Laragon window and click the "Web" page at the bottom. In the browser, type in:

```
http://foldername.oo
```

In this case it would be:

```
http://videoapp.oo
```

That is the root of the project, to navigate to other pages, simply ```http://videoapp.oo/films/```
